# ðŸ¤– Introduction to Robotics

This repository includes homework written for the course entitled **Introduction to Robotics**, taken in my _3rd year_ at the _Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest_. These assignments aimed to control an Arduino Uno board [^1] [^2], to gain a deeper understanding of how to control hardware components with software. 

Every single homework will have its description, references, implementation details, and source code.

# ðŸ¤– Introduction to Robotics [2023-2024]

This repository includes homework written for the course entitled **Introduction to Robotics**, taken in my _3rd year_ at the _Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest_. These assignments aimed to control an Arduino Uno board [^1] [^2], to gain a deeper understanding of how to control hardware components with software. 

Every single homework will have its description, references, implementation details, and source code.

## Homework 02 - RGB LED controlled by potentiometers
The focus of this assignment was to control each color channel(_Red_, _Green_, _Blue_) of an RGB LED [^3] using individual potentiometers. 

I used exactly **3 potentiometers** to control each channel. Also, I have mapped each potentiometer's value to an RGB valid value with which I have modified the color channel intensity. This was the Arduino setup:

## Homework 03 - Elevator wannabe
This assignment aimed to simulate _a 3-floor elevator control system_ using LEDs and buttons. Also, to get more familiar with debouncing [^4] techniques and coordinating multiple components.

I used **a red LED and a pushbutton** for each of the elevator's level. Besides this, I added a **green LED** that is blinking during the elevator movement.
If the elevator is moving and another pushbutton is pressed, schedule the event in a _waiting queue_. ( source code for the queue implementation can be find [here](https://github.com/sdesalas/Arduino-Queue.h) )

## Homework 04 - 7-segment display controlled by a joystick
The focus for this assignment to control the position of the 7-segment display [^5] and to _draw_ on the display. The movement between segments is natural, meaning that they jump only to their neighbours.

After the _switch button_ on the joystick is pressed, the current segment will change its state (ON -> OFF, OFF -> ON). To reset all the segments, press the switch button for 2 seconds.

## Homework 05 - Stopwatch timer
The aim of this assignment was to simulate a stopwatch timer using a _4 digit 7 segment display_ [^6] and _3 buttons_. The buttons will have the following functionalities: 
- button 1: start / pause
- button 2: reset the stopwatch ( if in _PAUSE_ mode), reset the saved laps ( if in _lap viewing mode_)
- button 3: save lap ( if in _RUNNING_ mode ), cycle through last saved laps ( _maximum 4 laps_ )

Whenever pressing the **lap button (2nd)**, while the stopwatch is _running_, the current time will be saved in a list with all _saved laps_. If more than 4 laps will be saved, the previous laps will be overridden. 
When pressing the **reset button (3rd)**, while the stopwatch is _paused_, the stopwatch will go back to _000.0_; respectively, while _displaying the saved laps_, all the saved laps will be deleted _and_ the stopwatch will be reset.

## Homework 06 - Pseudo-smart environment monitor and logger
A system that monitors an ultrasonic (**HC-SR04**[^7]) and **photocell (LDR)** sensor to gather information about their state. The data gathered will be logged in EEPROM [^9][^10] memory. Sensors' values can be interrogated in real time, _or_ the last 10(**this number can be modified**) logs stored in the EEPROM memory.

For each sensor, a _threshold_ can be set. If the _RGB LED automatic mode_ is set to _ON_, it
will let the user know if the thresholds for the sensors are respected by lighting it _green_; otherwise, the light will be _red_. 

Also, the _RGB LED_ can be set to a certain color by writing the value for each color channel( R, G, B).

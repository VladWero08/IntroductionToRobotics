# ðŸ¤– Introduction to Robotics [2023-2024]

This repository includes homework written for the course entitled **Introduction to Robotics**, taken in my _3rd year_ at the _Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest_. These assignments aimed to control an Arduino Uno board [^1] [^2], to gain a deeper understanding of how to control hardware components with software. 

Every single homework will have its description, references, implementation details, and source code.

## Homework 02 - RGB LED controlled by potentiometers
The focus of this assignment was to control each color channel(_Red_, _Green_, _Blue_) of an RGB LED [^3] using individual potentiometers. 

I used exactly **3 potentiometers** to control each channel. Also, I have mapped each potentiometer's value to an RGB valid value with which I have modified the color channel intensity. This was the Arduino setup:
